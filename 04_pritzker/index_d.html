              When a person decided to become an architect, this is a question
              he or she would definitely ask. So did I. After more than ten
              years, I finally got the chance to explore this question with the
              skills and knowledge of a journalist, architect, and programmer.

                Besides exploring the “secret lives” of these master architects,
                another goal of this project is to explore how to make a data

                [1] I hadn’t done any researches about whether the three
                approaches would present information more effectively. They were
                just my assumptions. It might be very interesting to do a study
                about it in the future.

                The infographic created by Giorgia Lupi, Nobels no degrees, is
                my initial motivation to do this project. It is one of the most
                elegant infographics I’d ever seen, which is literally art.
                However, essencially, the primary focus of Nobels no degrees is
                the Nobel Prize not the laureates. Readers have no idea who are
                these laureates, what kind of life they had lived. I want to do
                a project with a similar topic but focus on the stories of the
                people behind.

                The World through the Eyes of the US is an interactive data
                visualization project on The Pudding. The way it presents
                information with different levels of detail gave me a deep
                impression. I case-studied this project and documented it in my
                journal. When I began thinking about how to present data in
                People Who Won the Pritzker Architecture Prize, I unconsciously
                adopted a similar way of showing information and organizing
                readers’ behaviors.

                I did the prototype using d3.js from the very beginning. As a
                novice d3 developer, the project’s form and content were limited
                by my proficiency in programming to a great extent. Therefore,
                after I became more familiar with Javascript, I added more
                content (there were only five topics in the original project)
                and visually polished it.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="reflection section">
              <p class="text orange-left-border">A topic about "sound"</p>
              <p class="text no-border">
                One more topic in the “CAREER ” in the original design was the
                first sentence of each architect’s speech in the award ceremony.
                This topic is actually very important for the project. On the
                one hand, I found a trend of speaking the laureates’ first
                language instead of English in recent years. On the other hand,
                I believe that listening to these architects’ voice would really
                bring the project to life.
              </p>
              <p class="text no-border">
                While most laureates started the speech by greeting the host and
                audiences, some said something very different. As the laureate
                of 2016, Alejandro Aravena, his first sentence was “this is
                going to be very tough.” Because the laureate of 2004, Zaha
                Hadid, passed away just a week before the award ceremony, who
                greatly influenced him. The project doesn’t need to include
                information like this. To encourage readers to explore more
                behind the scene, showing one such sentence is enough.

                    Technical Feasibility: after I learned React.js, I realized

                    with React. The current structure of the scripts is hard to
