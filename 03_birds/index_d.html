              The Birds on Earth is my first try to design and prototype an
              application using Augmented Reality (AR) technology. It is a
              handheld mobile video see-through augmented reality based on a
              series of images (a self-designed children book) as targets.
            </p>
            <p class="text no-border">
              With the curiosity of this emerging technology and the three
              questions in mind, I finally decided to start from a specific
              project to learn designing with AR: an AR application that can
              help kids learn about birds.

                1.1 Define the features of AR content
              </p>
              <p class="text no-border">
                Back at that point, it was not easy for students to access
                wearable AR devices, like Microsoft HoloLen or Magic Leap One.
                Therefore, I decided to work on a handheld mobile device, like a
                smartphone or a tablet. Unlike wearable AR devices, users using
                handheld devices would lose at least one hand’s freedom.
              </p>
              <p class="text no-border">
                So, my first thought about the project was: “the contents
                presented in the AR interface should be either intriguing or
                important enough to motivate people to take out their mobile
                device and open the application,” especially when AR experience
                is the main content of an application.
              </p>
              <p class="text orange-left-border">1.2 Brainstorm</p>
              <p class="text no-border">
                Again and Again, I imagined the image of a people holding a
                mobile device. Finally, another image overlayed with it. Holding
                a smart mobile device is a modern metaphor for holding a
                magnifying glass.

                1.3 Define the role of AR content
              </p>
              <p class="text no-border">
                Then I decided the content of the AR layer was “the answer of an
                interesting question.” Design the target of AR (the reality
                layer) as the “question” and the computer-generated images (the
                AR layer) as the “answer.”
              </p>
              <p class="text orange-left-border">
                1.4 Define the size of AR content
              </p>
              <p class="text no-border">
                This project’s scale is “table-size,” since presenting the full
                size of the virtual contents is out of the scope of the current
                technology.
              </p>

              <p class="text red-left-border">
                2. How to present the content in the layer of AR (the "answer")
                and reality (the "question")?
              </p>
              <p class="text orange-left-border">
                2.1 Decide the target type of AR
              </p>
              <p class="text no-border">
                There are many types of AR targets, like markers, images, 3d
                objects, etc. In order to create a story consisted of AR content
                and real content, it demands both parts able to express detailed
                and meaningful information. In this sense, target-based AR with
                images as its target type was my best choice.
              </p>
              <p class="text orange-left-border">2.2 Write the story</p>
              <ul class="section-list">

                  <p class="text no-border">
                    Tell the story from the perspective of aliens. The bird is a
                    kind of creature too familiar to us, even children.
                    Therefore, I thought it might be more intriguing to take the
                    perspective from someone who never saw a bird, say aliens
                    from a remote planet! It would be interesting for readers to
                    learn about what these aliens would behave when they first
                    land on the Earth and discover birds.

                    knowledge in a puzzle-solving process, expecting to create a
                    more fun and effective learning experience.

                In the current market, most books employing AR technology are
                simply using it to provide the 3d presentations of the contents
                on the pages. I think there are other two easily overlooked
                aspects of using AR in the traditional books (at least in terms
                of handheld devices):
              </p>
              <ul class="section-list">

                    It allows readers a chance to quickly switch between
                    contents that are more abstract and more concrete.

                    Normally, checking AR contents would happen after reading
                    the printed contents.

              <p class="text no-border">
                I decided to design the image target as the “hinds” of the AR
                overlay so that my reader would have some clues about the
                contents that would appear in the AR layer but won’t see the
                scenes described in the story. It would prompt them to check out
                the AR contents actively.

                I learned how to prototype AR experience through Unity 3d
                starting from this project. It opened my eyes to the
                possibilities and the limitations of this emerging technology,
                which became a solid foundation for all the design practice
                afterward. However, as a beginner to Unity 3d at that point, I
                spent most of the time to crack the technical issues, which left
                holes in the design process, like:

                    hadn’t done enough research to identify other features of
                    the application.

                    hadn’t designed the book and the application in a way that
                    would prompt users to read the printed contents first.

                After I finished the project, I checked the AR application
                design guideline from Google and Apple. And found that there
                were some places I needed to improve to create an AR experience
                that’s more engaging, intuitive, and comfortable for users.

                    Add a Walkthrough before the Main Menu launch, which would

                    usages before users encounter permission prompts afterward.
                    It would help novice AR application users understanding why
                    they need to give these permissions which might not required
                    for most 2d applications.

                    enjoy a more fulfilling experience. It would give users the
